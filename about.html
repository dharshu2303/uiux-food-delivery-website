    <h2>Welcome to KK Mess Restaurant, where every meal feels like home.</h2>

    <p>
        At KK Mess, we believe that food is more than just fuel — it’s a feeling. Our journey began with a simple dream: 
        to serve fresh, home-cooked meals to students, working professionals, and families who miss the warmth of traditional 
        South Indian cooking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our mission is to bring you authentic, hygienic, and tasty meals made with love, using the freshest ingredients and 
        time-tested recipes. Whether you’re looking for a quick lunch, a hearty dinner, or a weekly subscription, KK Mess is 
        your go-to destination for wholesome, mess-style food.
    </p>
